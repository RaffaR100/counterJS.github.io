### This is a simple counter created with javaScript. I created this project to test the basic potential of javaScript.

### The counter design is simple but streamlined, and features a blue/white background.

You can download the file and test its operation.

# Usage

To use the application is very easy. Once downloaded or opened, just open the "index.html" file and you will see the counter appear.
The "index.html" file has the associated style sheets inside, so you can immediately test the application

# History

I created this project as a test for a course I am taking.
This simple counter gave me insight into the infinite functionality of javaScript.
